## usage
1. `Robi.java` contains the main logic of the Robot.
2. `Population.java` control the generation and natural selection. 
3. `stage.java` is the stage for the Robot.

## Genetic algorithm
GAs use the same techniques as does nature in order to find a good (not necessarily the best) solution for a problem. 

## Unit test
Unit tests are in the `test` folder.
